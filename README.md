## **About the Author**

Gianpiero Moioli is a sculptor, architect, and professor of sculpture, virtual architecture, and history of contemporary architecture at the Brera Academy of Fine Arts in Milan. He has been a certified Blender Foundation Certified Trainer (BFCT) since 2008.

He holds an MA in Sculpture from the Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera and an MA in Architecture from the Polytechnic University of Milan.  
In 2008, together with Stefania Albertini, he founded the **Brera Academy Virtual Lab**, a pioneering virtual sculpture and architecture laboratory.  

He began using Blender in 2004 and presented his early work at three international Blender Conferences (2008, 2010, 2011).

## **Back Cover Text**

*Art Between Matter and Code* explores the intersection of traditional sculpture, digital modeling, 3D printing, procedural generation, AI, and immersive virtual spaces.

Contemporary sculpture balances structure and organic transformation while questioning authenticity and uniqueness. NFTs, blockchain, and hybrid artworks challenge the boundaries between physical matter, digital code, and metaverse experiences.

The book is divided into four parts.  
The first part takes a historical and material perspective, tracing the shift from classical forms to digital energy and examining issues of dematerialization and digital aesthetics.  

The second part focuses on creative processes: virtual modeling, procedural generation, algorithmic form-making, and artificial growth. It explores how algorithms collaborate with artists, creating evolving, hybrid, and unpredictable forms.

The third part examines five creative themes—Energy, Landscapes, Architecture, Memory, and Future Worlds—showing how traditional techniques merge with digital modeling and AI expansions.

The fourth part discusses blockchain, NFTs, and the metaverse, exploring how these redefine authenticity, ownership, and exhibition practices.

By following these approaches, artists and scholars can understand how contemporary art navigates the evolving intersection of matter, code, and imagination.
